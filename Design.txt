- React will server the UI

- Signalling
    - Server will be asked to create a room or join a room
    - Signalling server writes to a queue and expects a response to be written in another queue
    - Responce is a ICE that Signalling server sends back to the client
    
- Voice server will be passed an ice and room id
    - If room id doesnot exist yet, create a process and try to connect to the ICE
    - If room exist, send that ICE to that process to try and connect to
    - When room becomes empty stop the process for that room
